                <h2>Vehicle Fitouts</h2>
                <p>Logging can be a demanding task and accordingly operator comfort is important to ensure the logging process is undertaken efficiently. Most of our clients require their logging equipment to resemble a mobile office.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our vehicle fitouts typically include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Special purpose boom</li>
                    <li>Rugged flooring</li>
                    <li>Operator seat and desks</li>
                    <li>Tool holders, cargo barriers etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Traditionally, the Toyota Landcruiser has been the most popular vehicle. However, due to stringent OH&S regulations imposed by mining and exploration companies in Australia, there has been a move towards Mitsubishi Canter and Isuzu Trucks.</p>
